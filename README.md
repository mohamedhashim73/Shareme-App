# Shareme-App
Full Social App using Dart , Flutter , Firebase , Bloc , SharedPreferences.

some notes about the App :
- almost to finish the app
- need to finish something like :
  * when i click on the photo for any user , should open his profile
  * get the like status and likes number for specific post especially when i open postDetails Screen
  * add the feature for sending a photo as a messsage to the user i talk to him
  * get usersData when I get postsData, I mean get it inside the method for getUsersPostsData as if user change his data , it will show on homeScreen with the update.
  * finish the stories that shown in profile screen
  * if i click on my photo on the profile , should show bottomSheet with change profile photo or cancel 
  * try to use FCM with adding a follow to a specific user.
